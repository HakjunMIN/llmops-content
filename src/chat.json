    "content": "The moon's surface is a fascinating landscape marked by vast plains called 'maria', numerous craters, and rugged highlands. The maria, Latin for 'seas', are large, dark basaltic plains formed by ancient volcanic eruptions, while the craters resulted from collisions with asteroids and comets. The highlands, or 'terrae', are lighter areas that rise above the maria, consisting of anorthosite, a type of lunar rock. This diverse topography offers insights into the moon's geological history and the solar system's early years.",
